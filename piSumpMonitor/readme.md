  Have you ever had your sump pump fail?  I have, and if you don't catch it quick enough it will 
  cause major damage.
  
  This product monitors the water level of your sump pump to let you know when it is no longer pumping.
  
  It will send you an email when it detects an abnormally high water level.  It can also be configured to 
  send daily/weekly or monthly status reports so you know the system is working.
  
  It uses a tp-link 702N router repeater to log-in to your local network and a raspberry pi to monitor the 
  water sensor and send email reports.
  
  Configuration:
  <ul>
    <li>You will need a gmail account, get one <a href="http://www.gmail.com">here</a></li>
    <li>You will need to configure the TP-Link 702N to be a router repeater (instructions are supplied)</li>
    <li>You will need to select when and where to receive emails using a simple web-page located on the pi</li>
  </ul>
  
  You will receive:
    <ul>
    <li>An SD card that has the monitoring software already loaded and an apache web-server</li>
    <li>A pcb that snaps to the raspberry pi containing the water sensor</li>
    <li>My support to get you running if you have any questions: paulware@hotmail.com</li>
    </li>
