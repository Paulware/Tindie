  Have you ever had your sump pump fail, or had water collect under the kitchen sink?  I have, 
  and it caused major damage.
  
  This product monitors the water level of your sump pump or under a sink.  It will you an email or phone text
  message when it detects water.  It can also be configured to 
  send daily/weekly or monthly status reports so you know the system is working.
  
  You will need a wifi usb dongle or rj45 wire for raspberry pi to connect to the internet.
  
  Configuration:
  <ul>
    <li>You will need a gmail account, get one <a href="http://www.gmail.com">here</a></li>
    <li>You will need a wifi dongle</li>
    <li>You will need to select when and where to receive emails using a simple web-page located on the pi</li>
  </ul>
  
  You will receive:
    <ul>
    <li>An SD card that has the monitoring software already loaded and an apache web-server</li>
    <li>A pcb that snaps to the raspberry pi containing the water sensor</li>
    <li>My support to get you running if you have any questions: paulware@hotmail.com</li>
