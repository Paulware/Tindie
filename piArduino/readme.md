  Leverage your Arduino experience with the Raspberry Pi with this easy to use extension board.
  
  You will receive:
    <ul>
    <li>A DIY Arduino that can be programmed using the standard Arduino IDE</li>
    <li>SD card with Raspian and Apache web server customized to communicate with the DIY Arduino</li>
    <li>A USB to Serial programmer that is used with DIY Arduino</li>
    </ul>

  How it works:
    Serial commands are sent from the raspberry pi to the Arduino.  The provided sketch understands these 
  commands: 
    <ul>
    <li>read analogXX</li>
    <li>read digitalXX</li>   
    <li>write digitalXX</li>
    </ul> 

  I will fully support each sale and help you expand the sketch or modify the raspberry pi python 
  interface to handle more commands if necessary.
  
  Note: 
     This DIY Arduino does not yet support standard shields, but future version of the board will.
