  Have you ever gone on vacation and wondered what your home temperature was?
  
  This can be really important in the winter months.
  
  This product monitors the temperature of your home and lets you know when 
  an abnormal temperature is detected.
  
  It will send you an email when it detects a temperature above a level or below a level, 
  and will send daily/weekly or monthly status reports so you know the system is working.
  
  It uses a raspberry-pi connected directly to your router.
  
  Configuration:
  <ul>
    <li>You will need a gmail account, get one <a href="http://www.gmail.com">here</a></li>
    <li>You will need to select when and where to receive emails using a simple web-page located on the pi</li>
  </ul>
  
  You will receive:
    <ul>
    <li>An SD card that has the monitoring software already loaded and an apache web-server</li>
    <li>A pcb that snaps to the raspberry pi containing the water sensor</li>
    <li>My support to get you running if you have any questions: paulware@hotmail.com</li>
    </li>
  
  
  If you don't have a raspberry pi, you can get them <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/998">here</a>
